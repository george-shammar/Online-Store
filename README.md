# Online-Store
Online store for medical equipment and supplies.


The project is an Online Store for Medical Equipment, Pharmaceutical and Surgical supplies. The project aims to show case an array of medical equipments with their corresponding prices available for sale.

The project is made up of two pages, the Home Page and the Search Result Page. The two pages are linked together through the search button as well as the "See All" link. It directs a user the Search Result page where detailed description of the products can be seen.

The Home Page contains a high level view of just featured products while the Search result page contains detail description of the equipment.

The project was designed to be responsive with one break point, i.e 768px screen size. Below 768px represents small devices like mobile devices and mini tablets while above 768px represents large devices like big tablets and desktops.

The project was designed using the mobile first approach.

The navigation bar with the links changes to a hamburger upon shrinking screen size to 768px and below. 
The Search section contains "Categories", "Sub-Categories", text area and search button on large screens while the "Sub-categories" sections disappears on smaller devices.

The Home Page is divided into five different categories of featured products. On large screens, the number of products displayed per row chnages to four from two on mobile devices.

In the footer section, only the company's name and the social media icon as well as the copyright information are displayed on mobile devices while the page on large screen contains the full compliment of the footer.

The serach result page contains a group of checkboxes to facilitate prodcut search when the user selects his/her search criteria for the products to be displayed.

 Use of HTML5 semantics was demostrated in the mark up language while use of CSS selectors were also demonstrated on the style sheet.

 Bootstrap was not used in order to demonstrate the usage of core CSS properties and values with the Box Model and elements positioning using flex and grid.
